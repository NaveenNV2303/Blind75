public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<32; i++){
            result = result << 1;
            result = result | n&1;
            n = n>>>1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}


key points:

a&1 = tells whether the last digit is 1 or 0 || helps to carry the number
a^1 = gives suim wothout carry
a&1 << 1 = to shoft the carry to previous number. useful while adding.
count of a  = count of a/2 + a&1. 
a/2 = a >> 1;
